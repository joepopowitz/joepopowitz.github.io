      <h2>Packaging Projects</h2>
      <div class="project">
        <h3>Corrugated Hardware Storage System</h3>
        <p>Designed and produced a modular corrugated packaging system for hardware storage, enabling low-MOQ custom orders and generating $100k+ revenue. Created dieless prototypes, cost-optimized structure, and delivered full documentation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="project">
        <h3>ISTA / ASTM Testing Projects</h3>
        <p>Conducted classroom/lab testing on drop, vibration, and compression standards for packaging prototypes. Interpreted failure data to improve design performance and cushioning systems.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="project">
        <h3>FlexEdge Desk Mat Concept</h3>
        <p>Modular desk mat system with swappable edge accessories (pen tray, cable guide, wrist pad). Designed to improve ergonomics and user customization for desk environments.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Product Design & Prototyping</h2>
      <div class="project">
        <h3>SlideDock – Wrist Rest with Drawer</h3>
        <p>Created a hybrid wrist rest and storage solution for desks. 3D printed prototypes to validate feel and fit. Focused on solving clutter and improving comfort.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="project">
        <h3>Infinity Mirror Phone Case</h3>
        <p>Designed and built a phone case that integrates a lit infinity mirror using LEDs and acrylic. Demonstrated skills in layering, fit tolerance, and visual effect design.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="project">
        <h3>Pleco Breeding Cave System</h3>
        <p>CAD-modeled and 3D printed a modular cave set for aquarium fish breeding. Used spline modeling and natural shaping to simulate organic rock forms. Designed for function and easy fry access.</p>

      <h2>DIY Engineering & Systems Projects</h2>
      <div class="project">
        <h3>Greenhouse Layout + Grow System</h3>
        <p>Designed a full-sun raised bed greenhouse system with a vertical trellis. Focused on airflow, drainage, and plant selection. Built and tested in-season to optimize yield and layout.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="project">
        <h3>Rain Barrel + First Flush Diverter</h3>
        <p>Created a custom rainwater collection system including a self-flushing diverter for cleaner water capture. Designed for modularity, durability, and ease of use.</p>
